# BigData-Intrusion-Detection

Safeguarding computer networks in today's interconnected world is crucial for any business. The objective of this project is to develop a precise classifier capable of distinguishing between "normal" and "malicious" network connections (intrusions or attacks). This is achieved by treating the problem as a supervised learning task and categorizing network flows into benign or malicious categories using the provided dataset labels.

Using Apache Spark Structured Streaming, data transformation and refinement processes was implemented to ensure the accuracy of data analysis in a distributed manner.
Traditional machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors and random forest are used to assess the effectiveness.
